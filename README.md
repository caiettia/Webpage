# My Personal Site
Hello! Welcome to the github repo for my personal website. I chose to create my own website from the ground up as a learning opportunity to enhance my capabilities with Python using Django, AWS, and Docker as well as refining my CSS/JS/HTML skills. This webpage serves as a way for me to showcase the projects I have done and the skills I have gained along the way. 

# To Do
## Webpage
* Configure github action for CI/CD with docker images
* Explore webpage having a selection function to highlight a specific project (create a larger temporary window to see project info/github page?)
