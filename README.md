# My Personal Site
Hello! Welcome to the github repo for my personal website. I chose to create my own website from the ground up as a learning opportunity to enhance my capabilities with Python using Django, AWS, and Docker as well as refining my CSS/JS/HTML skills. This webpage serves as a way for me to showcase the projects I have done and the skills I have gained along the way. 

# To Do
## Webpage
* [COMPLETE] Configure github action for CI/CD with docker images
* [COMPLETE] deploy to AWS instance (docker image) 
* Explore webpage having a selection function to highlight a specific project (create a larger temporary window to see project info/github page?)

# Project Ideas
* Use data from WMATA Api endpoint to calculate on-time rates, average time between trains (create time blocks)
* pull wave Buoy Data from NOAA: [https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/] to forecast water temperatures/wave directions/periods/etc. (goal: log buoy data with logged surf sessions to identify the swell direction/temperature/etc. relative to how good my surf session was)
